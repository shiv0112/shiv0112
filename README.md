Data is today's fuel. The sheer power of data drove me to initiate my journey into the mysterious world of Data Science.

Like many others, my initial interest lay in Java programming, I was fascinated by building logic for simple programming problems. I realized my passion upon switching to Data analytics. 
Data Science has been my major point of interest for a year now, and my zest lies majorly in Machine Learning. I find it easy to code in Python, but I never limit myself to learning Python just for Data science.
I am currently in the 7th semester of my B. Tech. degree in Artificial Intelligence(AI).
My current interests are (but are not limited to) :

-> Open Source
-> Visualization
-> Python development
-> Automation
-> Web desi
-> Python development
-> Automation
-> Web design
-> Blogging (technical)

However, "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy". I am a guitarist, and I love sports and listen to music when I am not working or studying.
